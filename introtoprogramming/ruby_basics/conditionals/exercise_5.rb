# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

# This will print "My favorite number is 7" because the if statement will
# always evaluate to true in this instance. Expressions by themselves are treated as true when
# given to a conditional.
