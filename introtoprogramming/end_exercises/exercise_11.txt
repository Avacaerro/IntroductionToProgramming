# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

The ruby-docs API looks to be the best. The website itself is clean and easy to follow.
There are examples for most methods/classes/modules and instruction for using them.
It is easy to jump to a class method and view additional classes via the core or standard
library sections.
