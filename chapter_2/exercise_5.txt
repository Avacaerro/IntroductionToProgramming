x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x


What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

In the first case x will print 3. In the second case x will print nothing and an error will report
stating that the local variable x does not exist. x is not available outside the scope of the times block.
