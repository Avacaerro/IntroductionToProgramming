# In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil unless break is used. Locate the documentation for break, and determine what value break sets the return value to for the while loop.

break accepts a value that supplies the result of the expression it is “breaking” out of.
In this instance break will have the value of nil as that is what while returns.
